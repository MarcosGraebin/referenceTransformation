# referenceTransformation

The goal of this project is to efficiently implement a coordinate transform of a 2-D vector 
(x_1, y_1) into a second coordinate system that is rotated and translated as against the 
original coordinate system in 16 bit fixed point with a fixed point format of <1,10,5> ( one 
sign bit, 10 pre-comma bits and 5 post-comma bits). Both the original vector and the new 
coordinate system are given as variables.
